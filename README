# collecta

clj-collecta is a library for streaming events from the Collecta real-time search service 
* Based on Mick Thompson's example code on the Collecta Github repository and eventually will incorporate ideas from http://github.com/ashafa/nozzle.

## Usage

(require 'collecta.core)
(collecta.core/search-collecta your-api-key your-search-term callback-fn)

## Installation

Eventually I'll push this to clojars for use from Leiningen.
FIXME: write

## TODO

* Comment the code. :-)
* Reuse the connection object.
* Enable the ability to concurrently process messages.
